In February, the UF Machine Learning and Sensing Lab hosted a two hour workshop for GatorTRAX, a free K-12 outreach program run by Tau Beta Pi, the UF College of Engineering National Honor Society. Connor McCurley, Susan Meerdink, and Weihuang Xu taught 40 kids about machine learning and remote sensing through hands-on activities and presentations.  Connor McCurley explained the basics of  "How Computers Learn" and Susan Meerdink demonstrated "The World from Space".  Students engaged in interactive activities such as creating necklaces which spelled their names in binary code and guessing which natural phenomenon were displayed in high-resolution hyperspectral imagery.
