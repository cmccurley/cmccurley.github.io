My labmates and I recently presented research posters at the Warren B. Nelms Annual IoT Conference hosted by the University of Florida.  The two-day conference, which was the first hosted by the university, focused on research, education and outreach activities on core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, including security, safety, machine intelligence, interoperability and their innovative applications in solving global problems.  Guohao Yu and Xiaolei Guo (below) presented their work on machine learning for interactive image segmentation using weak labels in agricultural applications while Sheng Zou and myself (above) demonstrated experiments on hyperspectral target classification using uncertain training data groundtruth.  Additionally, my academic advisor Dr. Alina Zare (bottom of post) presented as a Signature Speaker for the conference.
