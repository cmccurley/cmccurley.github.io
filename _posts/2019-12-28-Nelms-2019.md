My labmates and I recently presented research posters at the Warren B. Nelms Annual IoT Conference hosted by the University of Florida.  The two-day conference was focused on research, education and outreach for core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as: security, safety, machine intelligence, interoperability and innovative applications in solving global problems.  Sheng Zou and I (Figure 1) displayed experiments on hyperspectral target classification using uncertain training data groundtruth, while my labmates Guohao Yu and Xiaolei Guo (Figure 2) presented their work on machine learning for interactive image segmentation using weak labels in agricultural applications.  Additionally, my academic advisor, Dr. Alina Zare (Figure 3), presented as a Signature Speaker for the conference.
