As part of the Ph.D. program at the University of Florida I had the opportunity to participate in Supervised Teaching (STA). I was lucky to spend two semesters teaching in both graduate and undergraduate-level machine learning courses under the supervision of my advisor, Dr. Alina Zare. The undergraduate course contained around 25 students, while the graduate course demonstrated over 170 (wow!) This was a great opportunity to practice sharing knowledge in my field!  

As part of STA, I learned valuable skills in course development and management, how to plan and deliver highly-technical lectures, creating and grading assignments and projects (which I did with some fancy custom grading scripts I wrote), how to run effective office hours and professional academic communication.

I was able to deliver lectures on Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis, Backpropagation in Artificial Neural Networks and Eigen-Decomposition, as well as lead detailed homework reviews on normalization techniques, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, among other methods.

These teaching experiences opened my eyes to the demands put on professors, but also made me excited for more teaching opportunities in the future!

To see a more complete list of subjects taught in these courses, check out the graduate and undergraduate syllabi.
