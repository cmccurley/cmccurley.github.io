I had the opportunity to participate in Supervised Teaching (STA) during my Ph.D. program at the University of Florida. I was lucky to spend two semesters teaching in both graduate and undergraduate-level machine learning courses under the supervision of my advisor, Dr. Alina Zare. The undergraduate course contained around 25 students, while the graduate course included over 170.  Wow! 

As part of STA, I learned valuable skills in developing and managing courses, planning and delivering highly-technical lectures, creating and grading assignments and projects (which I did with some fancy custom grading scripts I wrote), running effective office hours, and practicing professional academic communication.

Additionally, I had opportunities to deliver lectures on Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis, Backpropagation in Artificial Neural Networks and Eigen-Decomposition, and lead detailed homework reviews on normalization techniques, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, among other methods.

These teaching experiences were great opportunities to practice sharing knowledge in my field.  While these semesters revealed the demands put on professors, they also made me excited for more teaching opportunities in the future!
