During my time in undergrad at Missouri University of Science and Technology, I had the unique opportunity to act as Vice President of Scholarship for my fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon ($$\Sigma \Phi \text{E}$$).  The role of VP Scholarship was to oversee the academic progress of my fraternity brothers and provide academic support to those in need.  Coming into my position as a sophomore, I thought hard about the hindrances to academic success.  Missouri S&T is primarily a science and engineering-centric university.  This means that almost every student on campus is required to take the same core engineering courses, namely: Calculus I, Calculus II, Trigonometry, College Algebra and General Chemistry.  Research has shown that the main obstacle to success in engineering is an initial failure to grasp these core areas of erudition.  In order to boost the success of my fraternity brothers, I developed an academic program for all members in these classes, which I aptly named the *Sigma Accelerator Program*.   As part of this program, I personally developed practice tests for each of these five critical subjects, lead practice tests and tutoring sessions before each exam, created a fraternity-wide academic support system and academic mentoring initiative, required mandatory on-campus tutoring sessions, and personally followed the progress of students in these courses.  The instillation of this new program not only resulted in increased retention of students in engineering majors after the first year, but excelled students' progress.  After  the first year of the program, my fraternity achieved the highest overall grade-point average on campus, among 22 fraternities and sororities.  Additionally, the outstanding achievement of this program was noticed by the fraternity's national governing organization and contributed to my chapter being awarded the highest recognition offered by the national organization, the Buchanan Cup.  

The development of the Sigma Accelerator Program was an outstanding opportunity to create an academic initiative.  I was very pleased with the progress of students and hope to be able to support students in a similar way in the future!
