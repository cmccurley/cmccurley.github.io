I recently presented at the 2019 International Society of Optics and Photonics (SPIE) Defense + Commercial Sensing conference in Baltimore, MD.  This was my first professional conference and I was excited to share my research in algorithm development for wide-band electromagnetic induction (WEMI) sensors!

I attended this conference with my labmates James Bocinsky and Josua Peeples, as well as my academic advisor at the University of Florida, Dr. Alina Zare.
